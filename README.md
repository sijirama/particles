i'm trying to implement other cool algorithms to simulate alot of life cycles e.g
- Flocking Algorithm: the boids algorithm, which simulates the flocking behavior of birds. Each particle adjusts its velocity based on the average velocity and position of its neighbors. (i think this one will be mad cool tbh)
- Gravity Simulations: the gravitational interactions between particles, planets, or celestial bodies in a 2D or 3D space.
- Fireworks Simulation: a particle system that mimics the behavior of fireworks. Each particle represents a spark, and you can implement different forces and colors to simulate explosions.
- Fluid Dynamics: Implement a simple fluid simulation using techniques like smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate fluid behavior and interactions.
